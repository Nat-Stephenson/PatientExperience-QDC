<p>Positive:‘She listened to how I felt &amp; understood me. Because she understood she was able to provide me with care, support &amp; techniques that were very personal to me’, ’ he applies CBT intelligently and adapts it to my individual needs.’, ‘I really felt listened to and felt that they understood my problem.’, ‘Changed methods to help me understand, kInd and easy to talk to’, ’ Liked how the staff took time out to talk to me.’, ‘Treated with care and as an individual not just a patient.’, ‘The staff were friendly and listened to me. They made me feel as though I had an input in my care, which is really important, and can sometimes feel rare in medical care settings.’, ‘Because they work wIth you to fInd a Good solutIon to Issues and concerns.’, ’ I like my consultant and know that I am trusted by him to lead my own care.’, ‘I really felt listened to and felt that they understood my problem. I also feel like I was given options to help me choose the best route to fix it which was good.’</p>
<p>Negative/ wishlist: ‘Take time out to talk to patients’, ‘Staff could spend more time with patients, out of the office. Have someone who works here who has the same illness and understands.’, ‘Concentrate more on the needs of the patients and listen more.’, ‘The consultant on the ward would talk over me while I was having meetings with her. She never appeared to listen to what I was saying.’, ‘Treat patients as people, not a number. Listen to patients and make them feel heard.’, ‘Don’t ask questions in such a patronising way. It sounds so fake like you are forcing yourself to sound interested, when really patients are just a number.’, ‘Listen to service users and not be so judgemental. We know how we feel not you.’, ‘Don’t assume all older patients are stupid’, ‘They could have listened and taken my concerns seriously and we would have avoided the entire incident in the first place.’, ‘Provide someone who will listen to what you are saying not matter haw silly or bad you think it sounds.’, ‘Let patients be involved more in their care.’, ‘Involve patients about decisions.’, ‘Don’t put service users under pressure to make choices quickly, when they aren’t able to think straight and need time.’</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="information-directly-from-staff-during-care">Information directly from staff during care</h3>
<p>Relates to comments referring to information being received directly from staff. These comment typically make explicit reference to staff and/or use the terms ‘answered’ or ‘explained’. It also includes comments around language barriers when staff are directly providing information.</p>
<p>The emphasis of this sub-topic is on information which needs to come from staff, which distinguishes it from the ‘Staff listening, understanding &amp; involving patients’ sub-category, where the focus is on where two-way communication between patients and staff is required.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Positive: ‘Thorough, explained everything well.’, ‘Procedure explained well. Communication excellent. Questions answered thoroughly.’, ‘Explained my care to me in a way that I could understand.’, ‘This is all new to me. Any questions I ask they were there to answer them.’, ‘My son and I were put at ease on arrival, with all stages of the procedure explained throughout, keeping my son relaxed and calm.’,‘The staff were very good, and gave me the information that I needed.’, ‘FantastIc advIce and explanatIon.’, ‘Everything was explained well. The nurse managed to get the surgeon back out from theatre to speak to me when I raised the fact that I still had some concerns.’, ‘All staff very informative’</p>
<p>Negative: ‘Explaining better so I can understand.’, ‘Language barrier &amp; bad communication.’, ‘I was repeating the same questions numerous times and still wasn’t getting an answer.’, ‘But sometimes the doctors need to explain things better to you.’</p>

<p>Comments which focus on the provision of information or advice that could be taken away to be utilised by the patient (e.g.&nbsp;this could be through leaflets, information sheets, webpages, education sessions etc.) The main distinction between this sub-category and ‘Information provision from staff during care’ is that the emphasis here is on reference materials and information that can be taken away, rather than the ‘in the moment’ information provision.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Positive: ‘great communication and instructions.’, ‘leaflets - aids to memory’, ‘The sessions are full of practical information and are very useful for future meal planning.’, ‘It has given me some ideas to make things better i.e.&nbsp;a weighted blanket for times of anxiety.’, ‘Initial visit was very helpful due to lots of information given.’, ‘Informative, helpful and good resource.’, ‘Informative session, well presented.’, ‘All the Info was Good and useful.’, ‘ExcerIse sheets helpIng me and other thIngs to help me walk.’, ‘FantastIc source of InformatIon’, ‘Gave a better InsIght to dIfferent types of needs. Very helpful.’, ‘GettIng the exercIses by post wIthout vIsItIng the out patIents Is a Good way for some people.’, ‘Good materIal, well presented.’, ‘Informative, plenty of strategies to try.’</p>
<p>Negative/ wishlist: ‘May be helpful to have the food groups on a leaflets as I wont remember.’, ‘Email exercises to patient.’, ‘Clarification and information on COPD ( I’ve used the internet to source the information)’, ‘Be more explicit about what I/you can do to improve my mental condition, not just to provide leaflets - most of the content was not very relevant to me (at least not to MY perception of my condition)’, ‘Your website is terrible having several services maintain for different areas is inefficient and not at all beneficial to users. You could make you web portals and links much better. I was sign posted to you by my GP during a telephone consultation, due to the GP not being able to provide links, I had to seek further information directly, using the internet.’, ‘Increase the promotion that continence can get better even for older people.’, ‘More education session per week, to reduce staying time.’</p>

<p>Negative/ wishlist: ‘Communication from doctors and ward manager would be appreciated, as we don’t feel we’ve had a full circle of contact only from HCAs and nurses when we ring in.’, ‘Communication is often contradictory, phone calls are not returned, staff do not introduce themselves and I am made to feel like a problem, when I try to clarify what is happening.

<p>This is a wide ranging sub-topic which incorporates comments about diagnosis and triage, referrals, how people move between services and staff, as well as care plans:</p>
<ul>
<li>In relation to triage this includes comments about the appropriateness of the lines of questioning used by staff (for example 111 call handlers or receptionists), and the decisions made based on answers given. For diagnosis this includes the use of diagnostic tests/assessments to investigate symptoms, how patients feel about processes used to identify health issues and the diagnostic decisions made by health professionals.</li>
<li>In relation to referrals and continuity of care, comments cover how well services are integrated and communicate with each other (e.g.&nbsp;the sharing of records, healthcare professionals knowledge of other services etc.), and whether patients feel that they have been directed to the appropriate service. It also incorporates patient experiences around how they move between and across different services (i.e.&nbsp;in terms of negative experiences this can include descriptions of being lost in the system, falling between gaps, having to chase services themselves during transitions, for example from children to adult services etc.)</li>
<li>In relation to staff continuity this covers comments relating to patients seeing/ not seeing the same staff throughout their care, how people feel about this and any issues/ concerns in relation to seeing different staff. It also includes comments relating to how effective staff are in communicating with each other in relation to a patients care, e.g.&nbsp;when handing over.</li>
<li>In relation to care plans this includes comments making specific reference to whether patients have care/ treatment/ action plans in place and any views and experiences that people have in relation to their plans (e.g.&nbsp;whether they are/were sufficient, appropriate, actioned etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Positive: ‘Decision by Medic at clinic to send to hospital quickly taken and proved correct.’, ‘detailed blood tests are done to diagnose the symptoms and give appropriate medications.’, ‘I felt the right questions were asked, I was listened to and an appointment was arranged for me with a medical practitioner.’ ,‘The person helped me get to the right person and got the appointment that I require’, ‘The operator was very helpful and organised a call with a GP swiftly.’, ‘good liaison with hospital at home service and GP’, ’ ‘ConsIstency of nurse has been really helpful.’, ‘Like getting the same nurse’, ‘Great communication between staff.’, ‘gave me a personal exercise program to add to my existing program and gave me a follow up date before I left.’, ‘I was seen promptly, given a diagnosis and future plan of action’</p>
<p>Negative: ‘’had to answer scripted questions which we felt were not relevant.’, ‘I feel I should have had an MRI scan or lumber puncture to confirm diagnosis’, ‘An X-ray while I was here to ease the stress of the further time delay in diagnosis’, ‘The first call handler was good but she obviously had to ask lots of irrelevant questions.’, ‘The operator was great but unfortunately the questions I had to answer required an ambulance for myself. I refused as I only had a bad back’, ‘Feedback to referrer accurately, and promptly giving an update. Improve communication between primary secondary care.’, ‘I was referred 18 months ago but nothing. I was told that the doctor was going to chase up my treatment, she warned me that I may get lost in the system though.’, ‘My 17 year old son was told that as he was turning 18 soon there was no point in offering him any treatment. He would have to wait until he was 18 and then get in touch with the adult service.’, ‘in the document it provided me with next steps I could take, but it wasn’t very clear in my opinion what I was supposed to do next, as it pointed me towards three different NHS therapy groups that all seemed very similar I wish it was a bit smoother if possible.’, ‘feel like we have been passed from pillar to post with no resolve to the issues we had.’, ‘It would have been good to have the same carer so I could get to know them more.’, ‘Continuity of clinician would be ideal in a therapeutic based treatment.’, ‘Always seeing different people, continuity would be good. One nurse turned up having not read my notes so she wasn’t as helpful as could have been.’, ‘sometimes miscommunication between nurses and doctors’, ‘Communication around staff handovers as there has been a lot of repeating myself’, ‘care plan non existence.’, ’ at the end of the session there was no conclusion or a way forward left me confused unless I did not understand ??‘, ’The ambulance crew ignored my daughters asthma plan given to me by asthma specialist.’, ‘To carry out plan of care as discussed.’</p>

<p>This is a wide ranging sub-topic which captures generic comments about the environment which lack detail, as well as more specific information about layout, comfort, whether the environment allows privacy to be maintained, decoration, maintenance, upkeep, safety and security, and provision of medical equipment:</p>
<ul>
<li>In relation to comfort this includes information relating to the size of rooms, how busy areas are and how many people are in them, the availability and physical comfort of the surroundings, furniture (i.e.&nbsp;beds and chairs) and bedding.</li>
<li>In relation to the atmosphere of the environment there is likely to be explicit mention of the environment such as ‘ward’, ‘place’ etc. and how this made the patient mentally feel (e.g.&nbsp;happy, positive, calm, depressing etc.) and the vibe they got from their surroundings (friendly, lovely, homely etc.).</li>
<li>In relation to privacy comments cover how private the environment is, including the use of single rooms, curtains, whether conversations can be overheard and warnings when entering rooms.</li>
<li>In relation to decoration this includes how well decorated e.g.&nbsp;painted, carpeted the environment is, as well as comments around how well facilities are maintained, and experienced by patients e.g.&nbsp;whether refurbishment was needed.</li>
<li>In relation to safety &amp; security this includes whether people are protected from harm within the environment, if hazards are managed, as well as how belongings are protected from theft or damage.</li>
<li>In relation to medical equipment (e.g.&nbsp;medical supplies such as bandages, pads, machines, mobility aids etc) comments focus on if/how patients are receiving the equipment that they need, whether it is appropriate and how quickly it is received.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>

<p>Negative/ wishlist: ‘I find the seats in that ambulance rather uncomfortable but this is a very minor niggle.’, ‘not that comfortable in a chair. Bed would have been better’, ‘Somewhere more comfy to sit.’, ‘Better bed linen.’, ‘only place to sit was the corridor, which was very busy. A better waiting, area could have been provided.’, ‘Not enough room in waiting area arrived and only person in waiting room, then 20 others arrived’, ‘The reception bit could be made bigger’, ‘There doesn’t’ seem to be a lot of space anywhere.’, ‘Where at all possible, could bed s be provided for overnight parent, rather than the recliners.As chairs, they are fine, but getting any sleep on them is impossible.’, ‘When you’re there for a very long stay, your body ends up aching because of how poor the mattress and sofa bed quality is’, ‘More one to ones in private. Maybe single rooms.’, ‘It would be good if an Ambulance had blinds for privacy.’, ‘There should be more privacy areas, as curtains provide little privacy.’, ‘Just to encourage ’knocking’ before entering a room.’, ‘Reinforcing that knocking on the door and walking in without go ahead is unacceptable.

That have plastic bags in them itis an acsedent way tin to happen’, ‘Making sure enough of correct dressings in the home.’, ‘There is frequently an issue about having the necessary bandages. The nurses on the front line always resolve this, but they would be assisted by a better supply chain.’, ‘They could do with up-to-date equipment.’</p>
