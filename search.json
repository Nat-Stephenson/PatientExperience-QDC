    "text": "Why should I move beyond the quantification of qualitative data?\nWhilst looking at the volumes of data for sub-categories can be a useful starting point to understanding your data, you will miss qualitative findings and/or misinterpret the data if you rely on the number of comments. You should take care not to oversimplify by assuming that the sub-categories with the most data categorised within them, are the most important and impactful, or that sub-categories with a low volume of data aren’t worth further exploration. In relation to this:\n\nWe know that the Friends & Family test qualitative data is heavily skewed towards certain sub-categories, in particular ‘Staff manner & personal attributes’ and ‘Positive experience & gratitude’ so these will likely always show up in the greatest volumes.\nIssues raised in comments are not necessarily only experienced by the people mentioning them, for example only two people might say that food is consistently cold by the time it gets to a ward, but the reality is that this is very likely happening for everyone on the ward, not just the two people who mentioned it. In this way even a single comment could lead to improvements for multiple people.\nExperiences which relate to a small sub-set of people, will never show up in high volumes but can have a significant impact on these people, just focusing on high volumes means their experiences will constantly be overlooked. This is especially important when aiming to include the feedback from small populations and communities with protected characteristics for example.",

    "text": "How can I deal with large volumes of categorised data?\nLarge volumes of qualitative data can be overwhelming which creates a barrier to making use of it, a strategy to help with this is distributing sub-sets of comments to the most appropriate areas of your organisation where people are best placed to make practical use of the data. For example:\n\nAs the ‘Positive experience & gratitude’ sub-category captures information which is very ‘thin’ (e.g., lacks detail), it is suggested that there is little value in additional analysis of the comments. A better use case here is to simply distribute it to relevant teams as feedback which can be shared with staff and celebrated.\nComments mapped to the ‘Environment, facilities & equipment’ sub-categories could be shared with Estates & Facilities given they often identify areas that need maintenance or could be fixed.\nOther sub-categories such as ‘Funding & use of financial resources’ may be most usefully received by senior management. Some of the ‘Staff’ sub-categories such as ‘Staffing levels & responsiveness’ and ‘Competence & training’ may be most useful to HR or managers.\n\nIf you have limited resource to look at the qualitative data and don’t know where to start, you may wish to consider the following to decide which sub-categories to explore in more depth:\n\nPrioritise those of particular interest for your Trust. For example, looking at the qualitative comments for relevant sub-categories where findings from other surveys, quantative analysis, research or information from staff indicate there is an issue.\nWhere there are sub-categories you are surprised to see data appearing against, even if comments are low in volume. This could tell you something you didn’t know before.\nUse the visuals and filters in the dashboard to identify if there are any changes in the volume of information you are seeing for sub-categories, service areas or demographic groups. Explore what makes you curious.\nUse the inter-relationship between sub-categories functionality in the dashboard to identify sub-categories where there are indications that the comment content may overlap, then look at these in conjunction with each other.\nRotate which sub-categories you look at in depth, e.g., you could focus on a different one each month.",

Look for the reasons for these differences. Use any insights around what sits behind differences to report on where and how improvements could be made. Adding what you know about the context of the feedback can support with its use, e.g., did the feedback collected about a particular sub-category rise in volume notably after a change was made in that particular ward or pathway.\nIdentify where people are having good experiences, with examples that can be celebrated and used to provide positive feedback to staff. These could be individual comments or where you are seeing patterns of consistently good feedback.\nIdentify the characteristics that lead to good experiences for people that can be shared within the Trust to promote good practice and provide evidence to boards, departments, and staff around what is working well and why.

So comments with mixed sentiment (e.g. “the nurse was very nice! Toilets were disgusting”) just came out as “neutral / mixed”, thus belonging to the same category as a truly neutral comment like “everything ok”.

An example is given in Table 1.\n\n\n\nTable 1: True positive and True negative example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\nLabels given by qualitative analyst\nLabels given by hypothetical model\n\n\n\n\n“I really enjoyed dinner”\nFood & diet\nFood & diet\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the model has also correctly predicted that the comment is NOT any other label, such as Medication. The comment in question has not been tagged as Medication, and the model was able to correctly identify this, predicting only Food & diet as the label instead. Because it predicted a negative for the label Medication for the comment ‘I really enjoyed dinner’, and this is the same as the real labelling for the comment, this is called a true negative for that label.\nIn contrast with true positives and true negatives, false positive and false negative are when the model has made a mistake. For the example in Table 2, the model has labelled the comment with Medication, although this is not a real label for the data. This means that it has made a false positive prediction for the Medication label.\nIt has also missed that the real label is Food & diet, meaning that it has made a false negative prediction for the label Food & diet.\n\n\n\nTable 2: False positive and False negative example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\nLabels given by qualitative analyst\nLabels given by hypothetical model\n\n\n\n\n“I really enjoyed dinner”\nFood & diet\nMedication\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives are usually put together in a table called a confusion matrix.",

It is the total number of correct predictions divided by the sum of the overall number of predictions. Range is between 0 to 1, the closer to 1 the better.\nHowever, it’s not always the best metric to use, particularly with imbalanced datasets. In Table 3 below, the model mostly predicts negatives. Of the 10 real positive values it is only able to predict this correctly 1 time. This means that the accuracy score is high (0.91), but it’s not very good at capturing the positive class when it does occur.\n\n\n\nTable 3: High accuracy is not always good!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredicted Negative\nPredicted Positive\n\n\n\n\nActual Negative\nTrue Negatives: 90\nFalse Positives: 0\n\n\nActual Positive\nFalse Negatives: 9\nTrue Positives: 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall\nRecall measures the ability of the model to detect occurrences of a class. For our example above, the model which had an accuracy of 0.91 only has a recall of 0.1. Recall is best used when it is important to identify as many occurrences of a class as possible, reducing false negatives but potentially increasing false positives. Range is between 0 to 1, the higher the better. The mathematical formula for calculating recall is:\nTrue Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)\nI like to use the analogy of ‘recall’ as trying to optimise fishing by using a net. You are happy to get false positives (e.g. stones, debris) in your catch so that you can capture more fish overall.\nScenarios where a model might be optimised for recall include where you are trying to predict fraudulent bank transactions. It might be safer to flag more transactions as fraudulent (increasing potential false positives) and check them, in order to avoid false negatives.\nIn the context of pxtextmining, a model that is optimised for recall would perhaps assign more ‘false positives’. So you would be likely to get lots of labels which might not actually be applicable for a particular text. For a comment like ‘I really enjoyed dinner’, you might get the real label Food & diet, but also incorrect false positive labels such as Medication and Communication as well. The model will be more indiscriminate when assigning labels, so as not to accidentally miss a label.\n\n\nPrecision\nPrecision measures the ability of a model to avoid false alarms for a class, or the confidence of a model when predicting a specific class. It’s best used when it is important to be correct when identifying a class, reducing false positives but potentially increasing false negatives. Range is between 0 to 1, the higher the better. For the example in Table 3 the precision would be 1:\nTrue Positives / (True Positives + False Positives) = 1 / (1 + 0) = 1\nThe model did not identify any false positives at all, although it did have 9 false negatives, missing 9/10 of the target of interest. As we know, the recall was poor (0.1).\nThe model with high precision but low recall is very good at avoiding false positives, but unfortunately it also made a lot of false negative predictions. The analogy I like to use for understanding optimising for precision is that it is like trying to fish with a spear. You want to be sure that when you catch something, it is definitely a fish. You’re trying to minimise false positives, or anything that is not a fish, but you may miss some fish in doing so (maybe increasing false negatives).\nScenarios where a model might be optimised for precision include where you are trying to predict the safety of seatbelts. It is important to avoid false positives in this scenario. The cost of throwing away a potentially good seatbelt is relatively low, compared to the cost of equipping a car with a faulty seatbelt.\nIn the context of pxtextmining, a model that is optimised for precision may try to be more certain about a label before predicting it for a comment. So for a comment like ‘I really enjoyed dinner and the ward was comfortable’, which has the real labels Food & diet and Environment, the model may only be very certain that it is about Food & diet and label it as such. This means that it might miss the Environment label. This model would therefore produce more false negatives.\nPrecision and recall cannot both be increased at the same time, there is a tradeoff to be made between the two.\nStill confused? This video may help.\n\n\nF1 score\nF1 score is sometimes known as the harmonic mean of recall and precision. It’s an attempt to generalise the two. The range for this is between 0 to 1, the higher the better.\nIn phase 1 of the pxtextmining project, the metric that was optimised was class balance accuracy (not to be confused with balanced accuracy score).[1] This was a type of averaged accuracy score obtained across the different classes.",

    "text": "Multilabel performance metrics\nIn a multilabel model, one sample can have more than one label. The exact number of labels assigned to the sample can vary. For example, we could label films like this:\n\n\n\nFilm\nLabels\n\n\n\n\nThe Mummy\nAction Adventure Comedy\n\n\nShrek\nComedy Animation\n\n\n\nPerformance measurement for models that perform multilabel classification is tricky. There is little consensus in the literature about which metric to select. This is because, as with the single-label example, it largely depends on what we’re trying to accomplish. The performance of the multi-label learning algorithm should therefore be tested on a broad range of metrics instead of only on the one being optimized.[2], [3] The current popular methods for reporting the performance of a multi-label classifier include the Hamming loss, precision, recall, and F-score for each class with the micro, macro, and weighted average of these scores from all classes.[4]\n\n\n\nTable 4: Example of multilabel scenario\n\n\n\n\n\nFilm\nReal Labels\nPredicted Labels\n\n\n\n\nThe Mummy\nAction Adventure Comedy\nAction Adventure\n\n\nShrek\nComedy Animation\nComedy Animation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHamming loss\nThe Hamming loss is the fraction of labels that are incorrectly predicted. This ranges between 0 and 1, the lower the better. In the example in Table 4 above, there would be a Hamming loss of 0.125 as it only didn’t manage to capture 1 of the labels.\n\n\nJaccard score\nJaccard similarity index is the size of the intersection of the predicted labels and the true labels divided by the size of the union of the predicted and true labels. It ranges from 0 to 1, and 1 is the perfect score. However, if there are no true or predicted labels, the sklearn implementation of Jaccard will return an error.\n\n\nAveraging single label metrics\nAll of the usual classification metrics (Recall, Precision, F1 score) can be used in multilabel. For example, you could get a recall, precision, and F1 score for every label, on a one-vs-rest approach.\nIn multilabel, accuracy is sometimes also called ‘exact match accuracy’ or ‘subset accuracy’. This is quite a harsh metric, as all of the labels for the sample must be correct. In the example in Table 4, there would be a subset accuracy of only 0.5 as the model did not accurately predict all of the correct labels for the first sample, although it got 5 out of 6 labels right.\nYou could also obtain generalised recall, precision, and F1 scores for all the labels. The way that this works is the recall, precision, and F1 scores are obtained for each class, and then they are averaged out. They can be averaged in three ways:\n\nMicro-averaged: all samples equally contribute to the final averaged metric (in imbalanced dataset with many more of Class A than Class B, both would be treated differently according to the total true positives, false negatives and false positives).\nMacro-averaged: all classes equally contribute to the final averaged metric (in imbalanced dataset with many more of Class A than Class B, both would be treated equally in calculating the average)\nWeighted-averaged: each classes’ contribution to the average is weighted by support (the number of true instances for each label).",

As the dataset is quite imbalanced, and we do want to capture the less well-represented classes, the macro-averaged scores are likely to be helpful. I expect to use the macro-averaged F1 score as a very rough indication in the beginning stages of the project.\nHowever, per-class statistics will likely be most important for performance measurement and especially in the model tuning stage will be helpful for indicating labels that are proving hard to capture.[5] The Hamming and Jaccard scores will also be calculated to give an overall indicator of performance although I anticipate that these will not be the primary focus of model tuning. Unfortunately the metric ‘class balance accuracy’ which was utilised in phase 1 of the pxtextmining project cannot be used for the multilabel models in phase 2.\nDo note that there are other metrics available. The ones selected here are the ones that have been most commonly mentioned in the literature, as it makes sense to utilise what has been established as best practice elsewhere for generalisability and interpretability.",

    "text": "How do we decide which machine learning model architecture to try? There are hundreds of different types of models out there which utilise different algorithms to fit the data. As a former librarian the obvious starting point was to do a quick review of the available literature.\nThe main points of consideration when selecting a model are appropriateness for the task at hand, and the tradeoff between resource consumption and performance. For example, our multilabel dataset is very imbalanced, and the aim is to predict minority classes with good precision. Additionally, many of the most advanced algorithms at the forefront of this field also require huge computational resources - GPT-3 cost approximately US$4.6 million to train![1]\nSimple and computationally efficient algorithms like Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbours and Support Vector Machine may be a useful place to start and this is where we will begin our efforts, to establish a baseline.[2] Decision Trees/Random Forests might also be a useful starting point.[3]\nNeural network approaches such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) could be tried. These could also be combined using ensemble methods.[4] Some research has shown that CNNs with Attention, or Bidirectional GRU even outperformed pretrained transformer models like BERT in some contexts.[5] Given that the training time for a CNN on the same NLP task as BERT was over 90% faster this may be a tradeoff that is necessary given the resources available for this project.[6]\nMost cutting edge research in natural language processing for text classification focuses on the use of pretrained transformers, like BERT and its various relations including RoBERTa, DistilBERT, XLNet and ALBERT.[7] This is then finetuned to the specific classification task.[8] These can take a long time to train; for example, XLNet appeared to perform best on a highly unbalanced multilabel dataset but took twice as much time (22 hours) to finetune compared to RoBERTa and ELECTRA so this is something to bear in mind when conducting model training and selection.[9]\nAs well as selecting model architecture, text preprocessing is another area that will require some experimentation. For example, the finetuning of token length, or type of word embedding used can impact on performance significantly.[5] However, in some cases, pre-processing text can also only result in marginal improvements to the F-measure when compared to text ‘as is’.[10] Using pretrained word embeddings such as GloVe or BioWordVec can improve the speed of training, although there is the risk of losing some words in the dataset that are not in the embedding vocabulary.[6]\nWe will try several different model architectures, recording the performance of each one using established performance metrics. The best model will be saved and made available for use via an API.",

    "text": "We’ve had a chance to play around with a few different model architectures now and the main finding is that so far, as in Phase 1 and other similar projects, Support Vector Classifier is performing the best. We are currently prototyping using only some of the final dataset, and focusing on predicting 1 of 13 overarching ‘major categories’. These are divided into a further 50+ subcategories, which our models are not yet trained to detect, but this will be the next step, once the framework is finalised.\nWe have also tried out Distilbert uncased, which is performing well, if not slightly better, than SVC. However, it’s taking a long time to train (around 6 hours on average) and is very large, around 1 GB in size. It also takes a long time to make predictions, around 1 minute per 1000 comments. When we have the final dataset we’ll have a clearer picture of which model will be best suited for the needs of the project.\nThe latest development is that we’re able to combine the text with the ‘question type’ feature. Most of the questions asked by trusts can be divided into one of three main types:\n\nWhat did we do well?\nWhat could we do better?\nAny other comments / no specific question\n\nIncluding the question type with the text of the comment has improved performance slightly. The way this has been done with BERT can be seen in the diagram below. We tried both of the methods found in this stackoverflow post, which produced similar results. We went for the concatenated layers, however, as this means the model architecture is more flexible and can be adapted to include other features as well, if necessary.\n\n\n\nDistilbert model with categorical question type feature"

Multi-tagging of patient comments is a crucial part of this phase of the patient experience data categorisation project. The dashboard has always supported single labelled categories but we have now improved the dashboard to support multi-labelled sub-categories and categories (also called super-category in this post). The data format of the dashboard underlining data has also changed to accommodate these changes.\nAdoption of the NHS Identity: We made every effort to change the general dashboard theme and visualisation colours to follow the NHS Identity. This was done to provide consistency between the dashboard and other NHS-related dashboards since the dashboard is targeted at NHS-related organisations. Note: This project is still open source and can be used by anyone as far as you follow the MIT Licence under which this work is distributed.\n\n\n\nFig 1. New Landing Page\n\n\nUpdate SPC Chart of the FFT Scores: We used the NHSR plotthedots package to draw the SPC (statistical process control) chart. The now follows the principles laid out in the NHSE programme, ‘Making Data Count’, and allows users to easily see change points, and identify when rules are breached.\nUse Upset plot instead of HeatMap to visualise inter-relationships between sub-categories: Using an upset plot allows users to see the relationships and associations between the large sub-categories (over 40 different sub-categories) present in the data. Read more here\nQDC Framework: The landing page now contains a high-level overview of the data categorisation framework developed as part of this project and implemented to assign the sub-categories to the free text comments. see the framework for more details.\nVisualise trends in sub-categories: We added a plot to visualise the distribution of comments over time.\nImplement the Pxtextming API: We implemented the pxtextmining API for machining learning tasks (predicting the sub-categories). Using the API was a more efficient way to interact with the Python machine learning model compared to the previous implementation which requires installing the R version of the pxtextmining package, pxtextmineR, reticulate and downloading the actual Python models needed for the prediction.\nDownload complex comments and other data: We added the functionality to download the complex comment for further analysis. Also, users can now download the underline data serving the visualisation they interact with. They can also download all the historical data that serve the dashboard.\nFilter with Demographic features: Users can now drill down into the data using three demographic features such as age, sex, and ethnicity. This alongside the location and date filter will allow users to drill down the data to their target population and analyse further."

It is essentially a gateway that allows access to information. For example, when you ask an Alexa or Siri what the weather is, it will communicate with a weather service API to obtain the information for you. When you get an email notification on your phone, this is because your email service provider is sending a notice via its API, to your phone.\nStill confused? This video may help.\nThe pxtextmining API allows people to utilise the machine learning models that we have trained for the project to label new text. It makes the model accessible over the internet, without any installation or downloads required. All that’s needed is a few lines of code. Examples are available on the pxtextmining documentation website."

    "text": "Why did we do it?\nThe API was created to separate our R/Shiny-based experiencesdashboard frontend and the Python-based pxtextmining backend. This independence means more flexibility in the development of each. This also means that some participating trusts can utilise the model only, if they wish, and integrate it into their existing visualisation tools/dashboards for exploring patient feedback data.\nWe also recognise that although the code and models for pxtextmining are available openly on github, many organisations may not have the technical resources, time, or capability to run it themselves. Making the model available via an API reduces the barrier to entry and ensures that the project outputs are more accessible."

We utilised the Uvicorn library to test the API locally, and have ensured that the API is covered by unit tests. We are hosting the API on the Strategy Unit’s Rstudio Connect server.

Even so, we have to balance the load on the server with waiting times, limiting the number of requests to 1000 at a time to prevent timeouts. We also have a transformer-based model which is very large and slow, taking several minutes to make predictions from text, which we have not implemented an API for. Our next step is to figure out how to do this without completely taking over the server’s resources, and impacting too much on the user experience.\nWe also want to make sure that participating trusts are able to make use of the API, and help demystify it. Communication is key, and blog posts like this will hopefully help. We are also providing example scripts showing how to create API queries in R and Python, and have built a simple website that shows the API and the model in action.\nThe model that is used in the API is also still a work in progress, we know we have a lot of work to do to improve performance. But now that the technical infrastructure is in place, it should be relatively easy to update with new models, when we train them. If you’re interested in using the API, do get in touch!"

This project aimed to improve the use of FFT and patient experience survey qualitative data in selected trusts, working towards generating from this piece of work a national “support or guidance toolkit” to help drive service improvements. This project’s overarching goal was to create text mining software, originating in the NHS, which analyses qualitative patient experience data for theme and sentiment, displays this on an online dashboard and is freely available to all NHS Trusts.\nObjectives of phase 1:\nThe project was characterised by three distinct outputs:\nMachine learning model and dataset\nThe models that were trained in phase 1 of the project were trained on approximately 10,000 rows of data that were provided by three partner trusts, and coded using the Python scikit-learn library. There were two models trained that were able to predict two different targets:\nThe winning model for the nine themes was a linear support vector machine with 71% accuracy and 52% class balance accuracy on the test set. This is available on github, together with the code used to create the model and finetune the hyperparameters.\nThe winning model for the nine criticality values was a logistic regression with 59% accuracy and 44% class balance accuracy on the test set. This is also available on github, together with the code used to create the model and finetune the hyperparameters.\nDashboard\nThe two dashboards were created using Shiny/R. The model summary dashboard provided contextual information regarding the trained machine learning models. The other dashboard, experiencesdashboard, was one of the primary outputs of the project. Functionality available in this dashboard was:",

Participants were asked to consider whether or not the project outputs met objectives 1 and 3, in particular. The key findings were:\nMachine learning model\nOverall, participants in the evaluation found the algorithm useful, and felt that it could potentially save time and lead to better use of qualitative patient feedback. It was also seen as more sophisticated than the existing commercial solution utilised by one trust. Suggestions for improvements included:\n\nRevision of the themes/categories to better align with the needs of different trust types was suggested, as the phase 1 data was largely skewed towards community trusts.\nMore granular level of thematic tagging (subcategories) was suggested as being helpful as the categories in phase 1 were quite broad.\nPhase 1 had only 1 label for each comment, whereas all respondents stated that in their experience, many comments had multiple labels. The ability to detect multiple topics in a comment text was deemed important functionality in future developments of the algorithm.\nPerformance of criticality/sentiment labelling in phase 1 of the project was not deemed sufficiently reliable to inform decision making.\n\nDashboard \nThe dashboard from phase 1 was easy to use and the searching and presentation of information was commended. Areas for improvement included: More readable/understandable visualisations, through improvements to the design choices\n\nInclusion of trend data (showing changes over time) and other data visualisation\nAlternative output options e.g. PDF, Power BI\nA more usable/intuitive dashboard design\n\nProject management \nInterview participants felt that the project was overall successful in meeting its objectives, and expressed a desire to continue their involvement in further development of the solution. In particular, they praised:\n\nThe project structure, with its initiation and running from within the NHS\nThe knowledge and expertise of the project lead\n\nAreas for improvement included:\n\nClarity around the role of NHSE and increased input to help coordinate expertise\nMore structure and management for the project, as it was all centred around one individual (the project lead)\nBetter opportunity for participating partner trusts to interact with each other and to interrogate decisions and processes in the project\nInformation sharing, with a better balance between detailed technical information and non-technical explanations.",

    "text": "NHS England commissions the Friends and Family Test (FFT), a continuous improvement tool allowing patients and people who use NHS services to feed back on their experience. The NHS constitution sets out a requirement to collect and act on patient feedback – the FFT supports that requirement and provides a framework to do it. Since 2013, NHS provider organisations have been mandated to collect feedback (including qualitative feedback in the form of written comments) via the FFT.\nPrevious work by the project team at Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust has provided an algorithm/system that can classify FFT qualitative data according to categories and how positive or negative they are, but the system has not been tested on the breadth of FFT data available and the system tags to only eight categories, which cannot be altered by users. This system is also trained on responses to one question, which could impact accuracy when different questions are used.\nThe Patient Experience Qualitative Data Categorisation (PatientExperience-QDC) project aims to create a minimal viable product (MVP) that can categorise FFT data according to defined user needs across different service settings (e.g. acute outpatients/inpatients, mental health, community, ambulance, children’s services).\nThe project will also explore and increase the granularity of the categories with which the model can categorise feedback and support adding multiple tags to comments where more than one category is present. To help ensure all categories are fit for purpose a framework for categorisation will be developed using a ground up approach, then carefully validated and checked through a through a thorough quality assurance process.\nA founding principle of this work is that the methodology and code should be completely open. Providing the methodology and code behind a solution is important both to allow expert users to satisfy themselves of the rigour of the methodology, as well as allowing anybody across the NHS to run this code and benefit from the system without any payment. Moreover, coding in the open is an important way to build collaborative links across the NHS and government generally.",

Firstly, to ensure any new categories and framework are fit for purpose through stakeholder engagement and thorough quality assurance processes. This will involve a significant data labelling exercise to produce the required training data across a breadth of service settings. Secondly, the project will explore and implement multi-tagging methods as a priority. Finally, a user-friendly interface will be generated, including user guidance, with input from users such as trust and other stakeholders. User guidance will incorporate guidance on how to use the categorised qualitative outputs, aligning with training materials that are being developed by NHS England to support qualitive analysis.\n\nEnsure all categories are fit for purpose - they must be validated (through user needs engagement and evaluation) and checked with input from providers and other stakeholders.\nCreate a MVP that can categorise FFT data according to defined user needs across different service settings.\nBuild on the machine learning approaches used in the previous work, where possible, increase the granularity of categories to which the model can assign feedback by adding subcategories.\nEnsure the solution can be used on FFT data, e.g. from different service settings and questions. Through pilot and partner organisations, test and confirm accuracy and explore usefulness in a range of service settings for FFT.\nExplore a range of methods to ensure feedback can be labelled with multiple categories (and sentiment or criticality), for example where one comment contains multiple topics. The project will also consider how data is labelled and presented, for example splitting comments into individual mentions.\nDevelop a user-friendly interface (dashboard), including guidance, that meets user needs, e.g. easy to use, timely display of data, reporting and analysis functionality, triangulation options and inclusion of demographics. This will include options for both on-premise and cloud platforms.\nEnsure that the work is open, reproducible, produced with free and open source components, and work nationally to promote use of the system and its components in order to increase good practice in this area\nCollect user case examples of deployment and use of the solution for service improvement.\nCreate easy to use guidance material for deployment and use of the software for both cloud and locally hosted solutions.",

We decided to combine the three models together, in order to build upon their individual strengths and improve overall performance. In data science terminology, this is called “ensembling”.\nWe tried three different methods of ensembling:\n\nTaking all the predicted labels from each model. If Models A and B predicted the label “Safety & security” and Model C predicted the label “Feeling safe”, we would take both “Safety & security” and “Feeling safe” as the predicted labels for the text. This method resulted in a higher recall score but lower precision.\nTaking predicted labels only if at least two models predicted it. This is called “Hard voting” in data science terminology. If Models A and B predicted the label “Safety & security” and Model C predicted the label “Feeling safe”, we would take only “Safety & security” as the predicted label for the text. This is because “Feeling safe” was predicted by only one model. This method did not increase performance.\nTaking the predicted probabilities from each model and averaging them. This is called “Soft voting” in data science terminology. For example, if Models A, B, and C predicted the probability of the text belonging to the class “Feeling safe” as 0.2, 0.9 and 0.8 respectively, the average would be 0.63. This method worked the best, particularly when the threshold for accepting a predicted label was lowered to 0.3. This offered the best balance between precision and recall.\n\nWe have opted for method 3, as it offered the best balance between improving precision and recall. However, it also takes a longer time as we need to wait for all three models to make their predictions before we combine them. We are using this method with the slower “wait” API.\n\n\n\nDiagram showing how models are ensembled"

    "text": "For this project, we tried several different machine learning algorithms. The best performing algorithms were the Support Vector Classifier, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (XGBoost), and Distilbert. For the multilabel categories, we found that these three models were largely comparable to one another but that they produced the best results when combined. The Distilbert model outperformed the others for predicting text sentiment (i.e., positive/negative/neutral).\nThe Distilbert model is a transformer-based model, which means that it is very slow and requires a lot of computation power. When we tried to deploy it on our RStudio Connect server, we found that it was consuming 100% of the server’s resources! This was not sustainable and we needed to find another way to make this model available.\nThe solution that we have come up with is to use Azure Container Instances to host the model. Now, when users send their data for predictions, they get a unique results URL to check. A Docker container with their data is started up, which also installs the pxtextmining package and loads the models. This can take a few minutes, as a fresh instance is set up every time. The Docker container then makes the predictions based on the data, and saves the predictions (without the text). The process of making the predictions can be quite slow, approximately 10 minutes for 5,000 comments. After predictions are made, the original data is deleted, and the predicted categories are returned via the unique results URL. The container is then shut down completely.\nWe adopted this approach because it is more cost effective. We only pay for the length of time that the container instance is running - around 5-30 minutes, depending on the number of comments submitted. However, this does mean that it is a slower process overall as the container instance needs to be started up from scratch every time. It therefore makes more sense to use this for processing many comments at once. It’s also a slightly more complicated API to use, but we have provided guidance and example code to aid our end users.\nWe are still maintaining the API which uses the lightweight sklearn model. The performance of the model here is less good, but we think it’s important to maintain a ‘quick and easy’ solution as well as the more performant but much slower approach.\nDo you have experience with deploying slow, resource-intensive models with limited resources? What were your solutions?\n\n\n\nDiagram showing Slow API structure"

For the multilabel categories, we found that these three models were largely comparable to one another but that they produced the best results when combined together. The Distilbert model outperformed the others for predicting text sentiment (i.e., positive/negative/neutral).\nPlease see below the final performance metrics for the models that we have trained and which are available via the API.

    "text": "pxtextmining is a package built using Python. The package creates and trains models for categorising patient comments using the labels from the qualitative framework. The code is fully open source and is available on GitHub.\nOn a basic level, this is what is happening:\n\nThe dataset created using the qualitative framework is processed. This involves standardising capital letters to lowercase, or removing punctuation and numbers. The words are then converted into numbers, this process is called vectorisation. This is a necessary step to enable the models to handle the words.\nThe processed dataset is split into two parts, a training and a test set, usually in a ratio of about 3:1. The model is then trained on the training set. The test set is set aside completely and only used at the end to evaluate the performance of the trained model.\nDifferent model architectures and algorithms will be tried, each attempting to learn patterns from the dataset. The models will also be fine-tuned to improve performance. A full discussion of the model types explored will be posted on this website.\nAfter rigorous testing and experimentation, the model that is able to predict labels for patient comments most effectively will be selected and saved. This model will be used to label any new text comments that it receives.\nThe best model will be connected to the experiencesdashboard frontend via an API."

    "title": "Project development: Additional features",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When training machine learning models, a key concept to grasp is that of ‘features’ and ‘targets’. The features are in the inputs to the model, and the targets are the intended outputted predictions of the model. For example, in a model that uses the atmospheric pressure, humidity, and temperature for today to predict the chance of rain for tomorrow, the atmospheric pressure, humidity and temperature would be the ‘features’, and the ‘target’ would be the chance of rain for tomorrow.\n\n\n\nExample of features and target for a weather model\n\n\nIn the basic pxtextmining model, the ‘feature’ is the text of the patient feedback comments, whilst the ‘targets’ are the category labels for the text.\n\n\n\nBasic pxtextmining model feature and target\n\n\nHowever, the meaning of patient feedback comments can vary depending on the question asked. Take the example below, where the answer “Nothing” has more negative connotations when answering the question in Scenario A, whereas it is more positive in Scenario B.\nScenario A: \nQ: \"What went well?\" \nA: \"Nothing\"\n\nScenario B: \nQ: \"What could be improved?\" \nA: \"Nothing\"\n\nAs a result of this, we have opted to include “Question type” as one of the features of the pxtextmining model. From the data provided by participating trusts, we have found that the questions asked by NHS Trusts in their Friends and Family Test surveys tend to fall into one of three categories:\n\nQuestions on positive aspects of the service, such as “What did we do well?”, “What was good?”, or “Was there anything you were particularly satisfied with?”\nQuestions on negative aspects of the service, such as “What could we do better?” / “Is there anything we could have done better?” / “Was there anything you were dissatisfied with?”\nMixed or general questions, such as “What feedback do you have for us?” / “Why did you give us this answer?” / “What were you satisfied/dissatisfied with?”\n\nAdding the question type as an additional feature to the model improved the macro F1 score by 0.05. We have incorporated this into the model that is available via the API. Users of the API must provide the following information in their request, when sending comments to be labelled by the model:\n\ncomment_id: Unique ID associated with the comment. This is not used as a feature by the model, but enables the model to match the labels provided by the model to the original input text.\ncomment_text: Text to be classified. This is used as one of the input features for the model.\nquestion_type: The type of question asked to elicit the comment text, also used as an input feature for the model. Questions are different from trust to trust, but they all fall into one of three categories:\n\nwhat_good: Any variation on the question “What was good about the service?”, or “What did we do well?”\ncould_improve: Any variation on the question “Please tell us about anything that we could have done better”, or “How could we improve?”\nnonspecific: Any other type of nonspecific question, e.g. “Please can you tell us why you gave your answer?”, or “What were you satisfied and/or dissatisfied with?”.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal pxtextmining model features and target\n\n\nTechnical details on how we have achieved this are available in this blogpost.",

It ties the back-end, the Pxtextmining, to the data source via an API and presents metrics and graphs to help clinical staff and managers gain quick insight from patient experience data and further explore the free text comments. A key focus of the dashboard is to present people with the categorisation of qualitative data.\nThe dashboard automates the labelling/categorization of free text data (patient experience comments) using a multilabeling approach and gives users the functionality to interact with the data, do boolean searching on the text data, compare relationships across topics, visualize trends in the data, download reports, etc.\nThe functionalities highlighted here are based on version 0.9 of the experiences dashboard package. Please go here to see the update of the previous versions.\n\n\nThe dashboard is built using golem, an R package for building production-ready Shiny applications. The dashboard saves and loads data from a database and gives users the functionality to upload their unlabeled comment data (in several formats such as .csv or .xlsx) for labelling. The dashboard processes the feedback data and presents several insights using interactive tables, charts and other data formats for easy digestion of the data.

    "text": "Feature tabs\n\nUnderstanding the categories\nThis tab contains a brief introduction to the data categorisation framework developed as part of this project and used to assign the sub-categories to the free text comments, see the framework for more details. It also contains examples of comments that fall under each sub-category.\n\n\nCategorised comments over time\n\n\n\nFig 4. Comment Distribution over Time\n\n\nIt shows a visual of the monthly distribution of comments in the sub-category/super-category levels. This visual should be used to help identify patterns in the data, particularly where there are clusters of comments around a particular sub-category.\nThe plot is interactive and the box increases with the volume of comments. Clicking on any of the boxes will show the underlying comments (alongside key columns such as date, FFT question type, FFT score and assigned Sentiment, sub-categories and super-categories). The comments should be read to explore explanations for any pattern seen on the visual and to carry out any additional qualitative analysis as required.\n\n\nSub-categories people are telling us about\nThis tab contains a few information and functionalities. These are\n\n\n\nFig 5. Summary Tab\n\n\n\nNumber of samples in filtered Selection\nCome here to quickly see the volume of comments visualised in the dashboard. The tab shows the total number of comments/responders in the current selection (based on the filter applied from the sidebar) and the total number of comments/responders in the database (ignoring all the sidebar filters). The figure in the “current selection” represents the actual data that you are viewing in the dashboard. If you didn’t select any filter from the sidebar, then the “database” figures will be the same as those of the “current selection” figures.\n\n\nSub-category table\nThis shows a table of the number of comments in each sub-category. Users can select a sub-category from the table to see all the comments relating to the selection.\n\n\n\nComplex comments\nWe identify that there may be situations where the machine learning model might be wrong in the sub-categories assigned to comments, and this may be especially true for very long comments. We set some criteria to catch those complex comments for further interrogation. Below are the simple criteria used to flag a comment as a complex comment (if any are met):\n\nThe comment has over 50 words\nThe comment has over 5 labels attached\n\nUsers can view and download the data containing complex comments from this section of the dashboard.\n\n\nComment Search\nUsers can make a Boolean search for comments with specific keyword(s). The result of the search can be downloaded. The keywords used in the search are used as the filename when saving the data.\n\n\nAdditional data exploration tools\nThis shows an upset plot, which is a type of visualisation for analysing data with a large set (in our case sub-categories). The plot allows users to see the number of comments in the sub-categories association, i.e., you can see the sub-categories that occur together more/less often based on the number of comments they have in common. Users can’t interact with this plot but they have the option to scroll down and select two or three sub-categories to see the underlying comments they have in common.\nThere are two sub-tabs in this tab that allow you to view the relationship within a category (e.g. staff) or across all the categories. The column bar on the plot shows the total number of comments in each relationship. A selection feature is provided to set the minimum number of comments a relationship needs to have in other to show on the pot.\nThe plot is not currently interactive, you need to use the selection features below the plot to select the 2 or 3 sub-categories you wish to explore.\n\n\n\nFig 6. Inter-relationship between sub-categories and comment table\n\n\nThe visual should be used to identify sub-categories with relationship and the sub-category selection functionalities should be used to see the underlined comment and investigate the pattern. Please see our post on using an upset plot to explore the relationship between large categorical data to understand more about upset plots.\nThere is a known issue with the inter-relationship plots not fitting the screen for users on a small screen. Here is a quick fix:\na. Please access your browser setting (three dots (…) at the top right of your browser)\nb. Zoom out to 75% or 80%\n\n\nRespondent demographics\nTwo types of charts are shown here for each demographic variable\n\nDistribution of the demographics in the sample.\nThe percentage of the mean FFT score for each group in the demographic feature. Where a Mean score of 1 is 100% and 5 is 0%.\n\n\n\nData upload and management section\n\n\n\nFig 7. Data Upload and Management tab\n\n\nThis tab will only be visible to those specific users within your organisation who have the right to upload new data or amend the existing data in the dashboard.\nIn this tab, users have the functionality to\n\nAssign label to new data: Users can upload their data and once this data is uploaded the pxtextmining API is called to assign sub-categories to the free comments and the data is saved in the database. Users can then refresh their browsers to assess the newly uploaded data alongside their existing data.\nManage Data: Users can delete rows within their data right from the dashboard environment.\nDownload historical data: Users can download the whole underline data currently loaded into the dashboard.\nFlag comments as wrongly coded or as interesting: Users familiar with the comments data can flag wrongly labelled comments (or those which should be assigned additional labels) by checking the  box. Also, they can flag comments as interesting (for later download) by checking the  box of the comment.\nDownload flagged comments data: If any comments are flagged as “interesting”, they will be available for download from this tab.",
